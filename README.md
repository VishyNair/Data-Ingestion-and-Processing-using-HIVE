# Data-Ingestion-and-Processing-using-HIVE
The New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission (TLC) has provided a dataset of trips made by the taxis in the New York City. The detailed trip-level data is more than just a vast list of taxi pickup and drop off coordinates.       The records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations (location coordinates of the starting and ending points), trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, driver-reported passenger counts etc. The data used was collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab &amp; Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP). 
The purpose of this dataset is to get a better understanding of the taxi system so that the city of New York can improve the efficiency of in-city commutes.
We are only considering the data of yellow taxis for November and December of the year 2017.
We will do a basic quality check on data and load the data into HIVE tables and further do Exploratory Data Analysis on top of this.
